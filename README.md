# tic-tac-toe-app
An interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.

**Development Setup**

1. Tools and Environment:
   - Expo: Expo was used to streamline the development workflow. It provides a unified environment by bundling the development server (Metro Bundler), which serves the app code and manages assets. Expo also facilitates device emulation and testing on physical devices, simplifying the process of running and debugging the app across different platforms.
   - Device Testing: The Expo Go app allows for testing on physical devices. By scanning the QR code generated by Expo, the app can be run directly on a smartphone, making real-time testing straightforward.

2. Project Initialization:
   - expo init: The project was initialized with 'expo init', which sets up a new Expo project and offers a choice of templates based on the appâ€™s needs. These templates include options such as a blank project or one with pre-configured navigation, providing a solid foundation for development.

**Running the Application**

1. Starting the Development Server:
   - To start the development server, navigate to the project directory and run the command:  'npx expo start'
   - This command launches the Expo DevTools in your default web browser and starts the Metro Bundler in the terminal.

2. Testing on a Device or Emulator:
   - Physical Device: Open the Expo Go app on your smartphone. Use the app to scan the QR code displayed in the Expo DevTools or terminal. This allows you to view and interact with the app on your device in real-time.
   - Emulator/Simulator: You can also test the app on an emulator or simulator:
     - Android Emulator: Press 'a' in the Metro Bundler terminal to open the app in an Android emulator.
     - iOS Simulator: Press 'i' in the Metro Bundler terminal to open the app in an iOS simulator, if you have Xcode installed.

3. Live Reloading:
   - The development server supports live reloading, which means that any changes you make to the code are automatically reflected in the running app without needing to manually refresh or rebuild.
  
**Handling Dependencies and Compatibility**

1. Version Management:
   - Compatibility Checks: Maintaining compatibility between React Native, Expo, and other dependencies is essential for app stability. The 'expo doctor --fix-dependencies' command was used to automatically identify and resolve any compatibility issues by installing the correct versions of dependencies aligned with the Expo SDK version.
   - Manual Installation: For precise control, 'expo install [package-name]' was utilized to install specific versions of libraries known to be compatible with the current Expo SDK. This approach ensures that dependencies work seamlessly with the Expo environment.

2. Updating Packages:
   - Keeping Packages Up-to-Date: Regular updates of packages are crucial for performance and security. The 'expo install' command managed package updates, ensuring that versions are compatible with the Expo SDK and avoiding issues with deprecated features. This practice helps maintain app stability and functionality.
